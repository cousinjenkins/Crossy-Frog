Crossy Frog is inspired by *Crossy Road* and *Frogger*. The objective of the game is to get the Frog from the starting point to the ending point, which will bring the player to the next level. 

While moving from the **Starting Point (SP)** to the **Ending Point (EP)**, the frog must avoid obstacles such as:
- **Cars**
- **Logs**

## Technologies Used
This project is built using:
- **JavaScript** (for game logic and interactions)
- **HTML & CSS** (for structure and styling)
- **DOM Manipulation** (to update game elements dynamically)
